### Data Description
This dataset focuses on electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States, with a particular emphasis on Washington State. It includes information on vehicle make, model, electric range, vehicle type (Battery Electric Vehicle - BEV or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle - PHEV), Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility, location (county and city), and utility provider. The dataset also contains geographic coordinates and census tract data, enabling regional analysis. The data was extracted from Data.Gov and consists of 29 fields and 216,731 rows.

### Dashboard Overview
This dashboard is designed for policymakers, environmental analysts, and utility companies who are interested in understanding EV adoption patterns, CAFV program eligibility, and electric vehicle infrastructure needs. 

Key use cases include:
- Identifying regions with high EV adoption for targeted policy or incentives.
- Analyzing CAFV eligibility to align clean energy programs with vehicle trends.
- Evaluating electric ranges to plan for charging infrastructure placement.
- The dashboard provides detailed insights by focusing on common vehicle models, states and counties that are performing well, and the distribution of BEVs and PHEVs across various electric ranges and vehicle model years.

### Overview of Charts
